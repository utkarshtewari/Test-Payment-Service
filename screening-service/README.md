## Overview
Screening Service at this point it does not have any functionality. It just consumes PaymentAddedEvent and publishes PaymentScreenedEvent.

## Running the application
* Build the application by running the command: mvn clean install
* Run the application by running the command: java -jar target/screening-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

##External Configuration
The project derives it's configuration from the configuration-service. We have defined the spring.cloud.config.uri in the bootstrap.yml file and that tells the application where to pick up the external configurations. In our case, the URL points to the running configuration-service (http://localhost:8888). 

Important dependencies in classpath
* spring-cloud-config-client dependency so that the application can consume the config server
* spring-cloud-starter-eureka dependecy to register the service in discovery server
