## Reactive Microservices
The high level of autonomy and isolation present in the Microservices Architecture pattern presents us with a problem of distributed data management. A microservice must be able to manage data consistency using transactions that are distributed across a network of many different applications and databases.

This subproject uses Event Sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) to implement an event-driven application.

## <a name="application-architecture"></a> Application Architecture
Architecture consists of 3 business services and backing services from Pilot-Microservices such as [Configuration Service] (https://code.cognizant.com/mrudul-palvankar/Pilot-Microservices/blob/master/configuration-service/README.md) and [Discovery Service] (https://code.cognizant.com/mrudul-palvankar/Pilot-Microservices/blob/master/discovery-service/README.md). Each component is built separately using their own build file. This application has been created to demonstrate a reactive microservice architecture. 

* Payments Service accepts a payment for execution. It creates an event PaymentAddedEvent in event store and publishes the same on event bus. It also consumes events published by Screening service and Accounting Service to update the payment events and the state of the payment being executed.
* Screening Service which is responsible for screening a payment, subscribes for PaymentAddedEvent, consumes the same and publishes PaymentScreenedEvent. 
* Accounting Service responsible for accouting a payment, consumes PaymentScreenedEvent and publishes PaymentAccountedEvent.

## <a name="event-scourcing"></a> Event Sourcing 
* Event Sourcing is architecture pattern that reperesents state as series of events.

## Using the Application

#### Running on local machine
* You can build the projects by maven. 
    * Maven: Run maven at the parent project "Janus-ReactiveMicroservices", this will build all the individual projects. Run the  individual project jar by running the command: mvn spring-boot:run

* You can run the applications in the order listed below.
    * Configuration Service - This application should be run first as it holds properties for all applications 
    * Discovery Service - This application should be run second as all the services register themselves with discovery server
    * All other services such as Payments Service, Screening Service and Accounting Service

* Please refer to the individual readme files on instructions of how to run the services.
